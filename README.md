A couple of cross-platform functions to help identify common errors when 
working with the file system.

These functions interpret the 
[OSError.errorCode](https://api.dart.dev/stable/dart-io/OSError/errorCode.html) 
value depending on the current platform.

## isPathDoesNotExist

Occurs when:
- Trying to open a non-existent file in an existing directory
- Trying to open a file in a non-existent directory
- Trying to non-recursively create a file in a non-existent directory
- Trying to list a non-existent directory

``` dart
  try {
    
    print(File('filename.txt').readAsStringSync());
    
  } on FileSystemException catch (exc) {
    
    if (isPathDoesNotExistException(exc)) {
      print('File does not exist!');
    }
    else {
      print('Unknown error: $exc');
    }
  }
```

## isNotEmpty

Occurs when you try to non-recursively delete a directory but it contains files.
