# [file_errors](https://github.com/rtmigo/file_errors)

**Cross-platform** extensions that help determine the **cause** of a caught `FileSystemException`.

Extensions were unit-tested on **Linux**, **Windows** and **MacOS**. 
Mobile systems such as **Android** and **iOS** have the same kernels 
as their desktop relatives. So their error codes are the same.


## isNoSuchFileOrDirectory

Occurs when:
- Trying to read a non-existent file in an existing directory
- Trying to read or write a file in a non-existent directory
- Trying to non-recursively create a file in a non-existent directory
- Trying to list a non-existent directory

``` dart
  try {
    
    print(File('maybe.txt').readAsStringSync());
    
  } on FileSystemException catch (exc) {
    
    // using property extension added by the library
    if (exc.isNoSuchFileOrDirectory) { 
      print('It does not exist!');
    }
    else {
      print('Unknown error: $exc');
    }
  }
```

## isDirectoryNotEmpty

Occurs when you try to non-recursively delete a directory but it contains files.

``` dart
  try {
    
    Directory('/path/to/useless').deleteSync();
    
  } on FileSystemException catch (exc) {
    
    // using property extension added by the library
    if (exc.isDirectoryNotEmpty) {
      print('It is not empty!');
    }
    else {
      print('Unknown error: $exc');
    }
  }
```

# Under the hood

This library interprets the `OSError.errorCode` values depending on the
current platform. It's two different error codes for `isNoSuchFileOrDirectory` 
and three different error codes for `isDirectoryNotEmpty`.
